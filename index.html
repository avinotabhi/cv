    <p>First-year Science student, future Data Scientist. My passion for coding brought me to the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, where I am pursuing my bachelor's in data science and Programming. This is my first semester where I will be learning about basic statistics and math required as a data scientist.

I possess Advance Canva skills which helps in making attractive posts on social media,
